                        The <strong>Buy and Hold</strong> strategy is one of the simplest investment approaches. You invest your available capital by buying a stock (or a set of stocks) on the first day and then simply hold onto your position for the entire investment period, regardless of market fluctuations.

                        On day 1, you use as much of your capital as possible to purchase shares. After that, you do not buy or sell any more shares. You keep your position unchanged until the end of the period, ignoring short-term price movements.

                            Suppose you have $10,000 and want to invest in AAPL, which is trading at $200 per share. On day 1, you buy 50 shares ($10,000 / $200 = 50). You then hold these shares for the entire investment period, regardless of how the price changes day to day.
