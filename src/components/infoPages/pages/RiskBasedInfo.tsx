                    A risk-based position adjustment means you calculate the amount of stocks to hold using your
                    preferred risk tolerance.
                    This approach ensures that your investment exposure matches the level of risk you are comfortable
                    taking.

                        By considering your risk tolerance, you can determine the optimal position size for each stock.
                        This helps you manage potential losses and maintain a balanced portfolio, especially during
                        volatile market conditions.

                        price changes.

                        day. This allows your position size to change dynamically in response to changes in the stock's
                        risk or price, helping you stay aligned with your risk tolerance as market conditions evolve.

                        to 100 shares ($10,000 / $100 = 100).<br/><br/>
