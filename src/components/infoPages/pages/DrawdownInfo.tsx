                    Drawdowns measure the decline from the highest price to a subsequent lower price over a specific
                    period. They are a key metric for understanding the potential losses and risks associated with an
                    investment.

                        A drawdown is calculated as the percentage difference between the highest price reached and the
                        current price on a given day. It provides insight into the magnitude of losses during a specific
                        period. Drawdowns are particularly useful for evaluating the risk of an investment strategy and

                        for understanding the overall risk profile of an investment strategy and how often it
                        experiences losses.

                        high maximum drawdown indicates significant risk, as it shows the most substantial loss an
                        investor could have experienced during the period.
